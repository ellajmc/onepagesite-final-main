            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The 21st century looms as a pivotal period in the ongoing human story.
              This is a tale that has been gathering momentum for centuries as we have made
              increasingly extensive and intensive use of our planet's continents, islands, and
              oceans to the extent that many parts of the Earth System at large are now showing
              the strain. As the size and affluence of the human population have grown, we have
              placed increasing demands on natural resources, leading to cascading
              stresses and impacts upon the natural world that serves as the planetary life-support system for all human societies. Those impacts are evident through climate
              change, loss of biodiversity and ecosystem resilience, changes to the great natural
              cycles of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and other essential elements, overuse of
              surface water and groundwater resources and in threats to food security. These
              developments collectively define the challenge of environmental sustainability.
          </p>
          <p>The social challenges facing the world in general and Australia in particular are
              as great as the environmental challenges. Demographic, cultural, economic, and
              technological transformations are profoundly altering patterns of living, well-being
              and health around the world in ways that often magnify inequalities. People
              and societies value fairness and cooperation because they enhance cohesion,
              productivity and creativity and are prerequisites for social sustainability. Further,
              a fair and cooperative society recognizes the value inherent in cultural, ethnic,
              behavioral, and other forms of diversity. In these senses, a socially equitable
              society is just as important as an environmentally sustainable one.

              <h2>1750</h2>
              <p>This economic transformation changed not only how work was done and goods were produced, but it also altered how people related both to one another and to the planet at large. This wholesale change in societal organization continues today, and it has produced several effects that have rippled throughout Earth’s political, ecological, and cultural spheres.</p>

              <h2>1938</h2>
              <p>In 1938, steam engineer, Guy Callendar decided to take a break from his day job and began painstakingly collecting records from 147 weather stations across the world. Doing all his calculations by hand, he discovered that global temperatures had risen 0.3°C over the previous 50 years.
                Callendar argued that carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from industry were responsible for global warming. However, this was largely ignored by other scientists who did not believe that humans could impact such a large system as the climate.
                Remarkably, despite his crude methods, Callendar's estimates of global warming were extremely accurate and in line with modern assessments.

              <h2>1958</h2>
              <p>In 1958, a young postgraduate geochemist called Charles David Keeling decided to compare the amounts of CO2 in water and air.
                Nobody had ever really tried to measure the level of CO2 in the atmosphere before, so there was no off-the-shelf equipment he could use. 
              He designed his own apparatus and set off to a weather observation station on the top of the Mauna Loa volcano in Hawaii. Once there, he took meticulous measurements every day and within five years he had provided the first unequivocal proof that CO2 concentrations were rising.
              Whats more, by analysing the CO2 in his samples, Dr Keeling was able to attribute this rise to the use of fossil fuels. 
              Although some scientists in the 19th century had argued that burning fossil fuels could increase CO2 levels in the atmosphere, these concerns had remained largely hypothetical. 
              Dr Keelings discovery was one of the most important scientific works of the 20th century. Since then, daily readings at Mauna Loa have continued almost uninterrupted for more than 60 years. The 'Keeling Curve', which documents changes in CO2 levels over time, is the longest continuous record of CO2 concentrations in the world.

              <h2>1991</h2>
              <p>Delabole Wind Farm in North Cornwall was the first commercial wind farm in the UK, completed and commissioned in 1991 by the Edwards family. 
                Since then, the UK has continued to embrace wind energy.        
                The UK's first demonstration offshore wind farm was installed in December 2000 off the Northumberland coast. It consisted of two 2 megawatt (MW) wind turbines with a rotor diameter of 66 metres. At the time, these were the largest turbines installed offshore in the world.              
                North Hoyle, the UKs first commercial wind farm, followed shortly afterwards in 2003. It was situated off the North Wales coast, and consisted of 30 turbines with a rotor diameter of 80 metres, each producing 2MW.             
                Fast forward to today, and Britain is the global leader in offshore wind energy, with offshore turbines contributing around 10% of the UK's power in the third quarter of 2019.              
                That year, the worlds largest, and the very first, one gigawatt offshore wind farm began operation off the Yorkshire coast. Hornsea One has a whopping 174 turbines, each producing 7MW, and is almost double the capacity of the previous largest offshore wind farm.             
                The UKs offshore wind capacity is set to double over the next decade.

              <h2>2007</h2>
              <p>The International Polar Year 2007-2008 was the largest campaign ever mounted to explore Earths polar regions. 
                Around 50,000 scientists, students and support staff from over 60 nations convened to unlock the secrets of the Arctic and Antarctic.           
                What they found was alarming. The Greenland ice sheet, parts of the Antarctic ice sheet, and Arctic sea ice are melting at rates that are unprecedented in the last 10,000 years.          
                Climate change is already having a measurable effect on lifeforms throughout the food chain, from microbes to polar bears.          
                The poles are also warming faster than the rest of the planet, one of the key predictions of climate models.          
                One of the reasons for this increased warming is due to something called Ice-albedo feedback. Ice is highly reflective, so a lot of solar radiation that hits the polar regions bounces back into space.          
                However, as the planet warms and ice caps melt, less light is reflected, leading to even more warming.         
                This is an example of 'positive feedback' in climate change, where warming accelerates further change.

              <h2>2021</h2>
              <p>The findings are reported in the latest Assessment Report by the IPCC, the worlds leading authority on climate science. 
                The report delivers scientists starkest warning yet about the deepening climate emergency. It warns that we are already observing changes in the Earths climate that are unprecedented in thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of years.  
                They include more intense rainfall and associated flooding, more intense drought in many regions, sea level rises in coastal areas, permafrost thawing, ocean acidification and others.  
                The report says that these changes are 'unequivocally' caused by humans burning fossil fuels.  
                The assessment predicts that temperatures are likely to rise to more than 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels within just two decades.  
                This means that many changes such as sea level rises, the melting of Arctic ice and the warming and acidification of the oceans, are now irreversible and set in stone.  
                Its not too late to prevent further warming of 2°C; through drastically reducing carbon emissions in the next decade.
                The 1.5C target is crucial, because beyond this point climate tipping points become more likely. 
                Tipping points are when rising temperatures trigger a series of cascading events with dire consequences. For example melting Arctic permafrost releases methane into the atmosphere, which causes even more warming.

<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<p>Failure to act now to tackle intergenerational challenges will result in severe economic, fiscal and environmental consequences. The steps we take today will reduce future adjustment costs and the economic and fiscal consequences of ageing. 
</p>
  <h3>Responsible economic management</h3> 
  <p>The three pillars of productivity, participation and population are the key to sustainable economic growth. Higher productivity is supported by the Government’s investments in nation building infrastructure, skills and education. Nation building investment in transport, communication, hospitals and schools will support productivity and provide infrastructure for a growing population. Reforms in education and training, health and employment services, and incentives such as the childcare tax rebate and ongoing tax reform will support higher workforce participation. These investments are complemented by sound monetary and fiscal policies and the microeconomic reform agenda. 
  </p>
    <h3>Fiscal strategy</h3> 
  <p>The fiscal strategy will keep real growth in spending to 2 per cent, when the economy is growing strongly, until the Budget returns to surplus. It will bring structural improvements to the Budget, reducing the fiscal pressures of ageing and escalating health costs. 
  </p>
    <h3>Health reform</h3> 
  <p>The Government has established the National Health and Hospitals Reform Commission and is committed to reforming our health and hospitals system so every health dollar will buy more and better quality health services. 
  </p>
    <h3>The Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme (CPRS)</h3> 
  <p>The CPRS will deliver significant reductions in greenhouse gases in the most cost effective way, while protecting jobs and businesses. 32 countries are already operating emissions trading schemes and more are in the process of introducing them.
